## Introduction

Wallet can be thought of as a group of user accounts. Each wallet has its own seed. A private key that represents an account can be generated by hashing the seed and a nonce.

## Usage with Python SDK

In Python SDK we have a `Wallet` class that represents a wallet on the VSYS blockchain.

### Properties

#### Seed
The seed of the wallet.

```python
import py_vsys as pv

# wal: pv.Wallet

print(wal.seed)
```
Example output

```
Seed(choose icon security demise fashion robot file dune green play social define clump hedgehog issue)
```

### Actions

#### Register a new Wallet
Register a new wallet(i.e. generate a new seed)

```python
import py_vsys as pv

wal = pv.Wallet.register()
print(wal)
```
Example output

```
<py_vsys.account.Wallet object at 0x10650bc40>
```

#### Instantiate from an Existing Seed
Instantiate `Wallet` from an existing seed.

```python
import py_vsys as pv

seed_str = "choose icon security demise fashion robot file dune green play social define clump hedgehog issue"

wal = pv.Wallet.from_seed_str(seed_str)
print(wal.seed)

seed = pv.Seed(seed_str)
wal = pv.Wallet(seed)
print(wal.seed)
```
Example output

```
Seed(choose icon security demise fashion robot file dune green play social define clump hedgehog issue)
Seed(choose icon security demise fashion robot file dune green play social define clump hedgehog issue)
```

#### Get Account Object for a Certain Nonce
Get the `Account` object for a certain nonce.

```python
import py_vsys as pv

# ch: pv.Chain

wal = pv.Wallet.register()
acnt0 = wal.get_account(chain=ch, nonce=0)
print(acnt0.addr)
acnt1 = wal.get_account(chain=ch, nonce=1)
print(acnt1.addr)
```
Example output

```
Addr(ATraTqyhkHfbMAJawsyZeikkgS3nxy2iM5A)
Addr(AUCkJmLvAYsHjS9vV9NZ32XJ5BBYGPvvatJ)
```
